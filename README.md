Project topic: Trade Finance Paymentusing Smart Contracts 

Premise of Smart Contract
    This transaction is to facilitate the payment for goods being imported and works as an effective Escrow Account. The Smart Contract will allow the Importer to first verify the status of the imported goods before the funds are released to the Exporter.

Advantages to current TradFi:
    - Real-time review and access 
    - Transparency of terms and transactions
    - Increased efficiency
    - Disintermediation from banks who charge for escrow services

High Lever Process
    1. Exporter to send payment amount and description of goods
    2. Importer to make payment of set amount
    3. Payment is released when Importer confirms the receipt of goods
