Project topic: Non Fungible Token Smart Contract for Car Manufacturer 

Premise of Smart Contract

    This Smart Contract will allow car manufacturers to issue Non Fungible Tokens for each vehicle that they produce. The token number will be matched to the VIN number of the vehicle and allow for a distributed ledger of ownership. When the vehicle is first purchased, the token will be minted into the account of the owner. The token can then be transfered when the vehicle is sold to the next owner. This will allow prospective purchasers to validate the authenticity of the vehicle, verify the owner and provide an ownership history.

Advantages to current TradFi:

    - Real-time review and access of ownership history and credentials
    - Transparency of terms and details of the transactions
    - Increased efficiency instead of using vehicle titles
    - Removal of central governmental authorities that cause delays and additional costs

High Level Process

    1. Manufacturer (Contract Owner) is able to mint tokens as vehicles are sold
    2. This will create a distributed ledger detailing the VIN number and the current holder
    3. Current holdets are then able to transfer the token when the vehicle is sold.
    4. Anyone can 'Get' the current holder of a vehicle based on VIN Number.
